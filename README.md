StarDist Segmentation Filter — Area-Based Object Cleanup

This script filters objects from StarDist-generated segmentation masks based on object size (area), using z-score thresholds on the log-transformed area. The goal is to remove outlier objects that are too small or too large.

---

Purpose

- Remove spurious small or large segmented regions
- Preserve only nuclei or structures within a normal size range
- Save cleaned masks, overlays, and diagnostic histograms

---

How It Works

1. Loads `_segmentation.tif` files generated by StarDist.
2. Measures each object’s area using `skimage.regionprops`.
3. Applies **log-transformation** to area values.
4. Filters objects with a **z-score between -1 and +1.5**.
5. Saves:
   - A cleaned segmentation mask
   - An overlay on the original image
   - A histogram showing area filtering cutoffs

Input Requirements

- Folder containing:
  - Segmentation masks ending in `_segmentation.tif`
  - Corresponding original TIFF images (same name without `_segmentation`)
